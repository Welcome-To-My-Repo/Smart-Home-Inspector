MAIN IDEA OF WATCHDOG

watchdog is a program that will inspect the logfiles of smart home
devices and display the logged events in a live generated video
representation where a mockup of the devices' locations inside the
building is drawn and as watchdog plays through the logfile events,
it will highlight icons showing which smart devices were activated and
generate and display any other necessary event information.

This is the main window of watchdog.

The left sub-window, logfile events, displays logged events as they
are written to the logfile. it highlights the event that it's
currently displaying.

The right sub-window, event diagram, allows the user to use a pencil
tool to draw a diagram of the building and drag and drop icons
into the diagram noting the location of smart devices.



SAMPLE BEHAVIOR OF WATCHDOG

start Watchdog

open new logfile

user inputs names of smart devices to be used as keywords

watchdog gives each keyword an icon to use in the diagram

watchdog parses logfile

watchdog sorts events by time and by smart device

user draws building layout in event diagram window

user drags in smart device icons

user uses play, pause, stop, and the scrub bar to view events from the
logfile

user saves their diagram, keywords, and referenced logfile as a .dog
file

watchdog can load .dog files to display previously inspected logfiles

MISC

option to save inspected logfile as a reference or include the file
in the .dog save file
