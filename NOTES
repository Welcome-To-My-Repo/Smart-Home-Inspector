MAIN IDEA OF Smart Home Inspector

SHI is a program that will inspect the logfiles of smart home devices and display the logged events in a live generated display.
There are two areas in the main window.
The first gives a text view of the logfile and highlights the current logged event.
The second area is a drawing window where the user can create a diagram of the location of the smart home network devices and position icons to represent the devices.
The icons will light up to represent their activation during a logged event.
At the bottom, there's a playbar to move through the logged events in real time.

Zigbee and ZWave possible syntax?

regex to get seconds "[^:][0-9](?=\.)"
regex to get minutes "(?<=:)[0-9]{1,2}(?=:)
regex to get hours "(?<=\s)[0-9]{1,2}(?=:)
regex to get days "(?<=-)[0-9]{1,2}(?=\s)
regex to get months "(?<=-)[0-9]{1,2}(?=-)
regex to get years "(?<=\[)[0-9]{4}(?=-)"

Instead of having to collata all the information from all the files, each log
file loaded can be analyzed and presented individually based on which log file
tab is selected.
